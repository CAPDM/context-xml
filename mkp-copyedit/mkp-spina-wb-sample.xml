    <title>What are neural tube defects?</title>
    <para>Neural tube defects (NTDs) are amongst the most common birth defects. The prevalence has
      dropped in the UK from around 4.5 per 1000 live births to less than 1 per 1000 live births.
      This is attributed to a combination of screening and preconception folate supplementation. </para>
    <para>NTD is a broad term encompassing a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that
      result from defective closure of the neural tube early in foetal life. The upper and lower
      ends of the neural tube close last and these tend to be common sites of the anomalies. There
      are 2 broad categories: open lesions when the skin fails to close in the midline, and closed
      where there is skin coverage. The presentation varies with both the site and the extent of the
      lesion.   </para>

            <para>All pregnancies in the UK are offered the ‘triple test’, which is a blood test for
              alpha fetoprotein (AFP), beta human chorionic gonadotrophin and oestriol. Many places
              add in a nuchal translucency test which helps to identify foetus’s with Downs syndrome
              and thus becomes a quadruple test. A raised AFP can be associated with incomplete
              closure of the spinal canal. In addition all women have an antenatal ultrasound.
              Together, these tests offer a 70% sensitivity marker of Down’s syndrome, Edwards
              Syndrome and Patau’s syndrome. Foetal ultrasonography looks particularly at the
              development of the spinal cord and canal, which in the hands of an expert radiographer
              will demonstrate the lesion which can then be confirmed non-invasively with a foetal
              MRI scan. Some babies may be offered antenatal surgery to close the neural tube defect
              and the evidence suggests that this decreases the likelihood of developing
              hydrocephalus. </para>

                  spina bifida by around 4-5 times. Young women should not be treated with sodium
                  valproate for epilepsy unless all other treatments have been tried. The advice is
                  that if on sodium valproate they should also be using contraception and they are
                  aware of the risk birth malformation in particular spina bifida and cleft palate.
                  To ensure women are aware there is now a pregnancy prevention programme for women
                  on valproate and they need to sign a form on an annual basis to make sure clinical

    <para>John’s defect was successfully closed and the wound has healed well. He had hydrocephalus

      stabilised on the 98th percentile. He has established feeding well. He has normal tone and
      movement in his arms but his legs are flaccid and held in a frog posture. In supine he is able
      to flex his hips. He does not respond to light pin prick below his knees. He has absent knee,
      ankle and plantar reflexes. There is no anocutaneous reflex. His anus appears normal and his

        <para>Monitor urinary tract – John should be followed up in a spina bifida clinic or urology
          clinic. Encourage the families to continue with clean intermittent catherization. The
          frequency of this will be determined by follow up investigations looking at John’s
          bladder. When seeing children with spina bifida, it is important to encourage good fluid
          intake, monitor their growth, blood pressure and urinalysis. It is also sensible to keep
          an eye on their creatinine at three months and then on a yearly basis. The best guide to
          the frequency for clean intermittent catheterisation is renal ultrasound that should be
          repeated at three and six months and then yearly. If there is dilatation of the upper
          tracts or a residual volume of more than 30 ml, then a discussion with the urology team
          would be needed. During the first year of life a DMSA and video urodynamics (if available)
          would normally be organised by the urology team. </para>

      nitrites and leucocytes, then it is important that a catheter sample is sent to the lab for
      MC+S, and appropriate antibiotics started. Provided there have been no recent infections this
      should be trimethoprim, but it is important to check if there has been any recent urine
      samples that have been tested as there may be antibiotic resistance. </para>

    <para> John is now 2½ years old. When you last saw him at 18 months he has been sitting from 10
      months and but needed his calipers to stand in a frame. He has a good pincer grasp and had 3
      words. His family describe that he is frustrated and cross for a lot of the day which is
      making home life challenging. He is tolerating twice daily catheterisations but recently has
      had 2 urinary tract infections. </para>

          spina bifida and/or hydrocephalus, the threshold will be met for Education, Health and
